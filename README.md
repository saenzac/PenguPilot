This a forked project that I used in my master thesis.
The rotation controller was implemented using a backstepping based controller.
Only the rotation controller is active, the other controllers services were disabled.
A simulation service was added for software-in-the-loop simulations.

What is PenguPilot?
===================
**PenguPilot is a GNU/Linux based Multi-Rotor UAV Autopilot.**

Unlike other platforms, PenguPilot does not require a dedicated low-level microcontroller for real-time

   * sensor data acquisition,
   * data fusion / filtering, and
   * motor control.

The whole flight infrastructure is based on Linux (PREEMPT/PREEMPT_RT) user-space tasks.

**Some highlights of the PenguPilot software are**:

- component based software architecture allows to run code on demand (power savings in standby)
- memory protection among critical and non-critical components
- message-passing among components via ZeroMQ/MessagePack/Protobuf
- process/priority management and dependency tracking
- online parameter configuration usable for in-flight parameter updates
- SSH based user interfaces for parameters, calibration, ...
- blackbox functionality to log sensor values at each control step to sdcard
- sensor data replay capabilitiy for offline PC-based optimization, filter tuning, ...
- quick integration of new hardware through Linux HAL
- platform-neutral code without low-level interrupt and timer programming


What's different compared to other Approaches?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The three main factors that make PenguPilot based systems different, compared to microcontroller-based autopilots, are the

  * **Linux operating system**, the
  * powerful underlying **computer-on-module** (COM), and
  * PenguPilot's **component-based software architecture**.

These factors generate a lot of possibilities and benefits for UAV software development, summarized as follows:

* **Powerful Hardware and OS**:
   - no microcontroller-like flash/RAM memory restrictions
   - high memory bandwidth allows to log every sensor value per control step
   - memory protection for improved task safety
   - USB host support (Cameras, WiFi and UMTS sticks, FTDI's, ...)
   - symmetric multi-processing (e.g. ODROID U3)

* **Advanced Programming Possibilities**:
  - high-level programming languages and libraries (Bash, Python/numpy)
  - rich networking and routing functionality
  - file system abstractions instead of raw memory access
  - debugging via GDB and code profiling without extra effort
  - myriads of open source device drivers and software libraries

* **Advanced Field Software Development**:
  - software development on the UAV via SSH from virtually any device
  - native source code compilation (no cross-compiler required)
  - on-device software version control via Git
